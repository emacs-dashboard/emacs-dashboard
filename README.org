* Dependencies
You will need the following packages which are all available on Melpa:

1. page-break-lines - [[https://github.com/purcell/page-break-lines]]
2. (optional) projectile - [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile]]

* Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
M-x package-install RET dashboard
#+END_SRC

 #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'dashboard)
(dashboard-setup-startup-hook)
;; Or if you use use-package
(use-package dashboard
  :ensure t
  :config
  (dashboard-setup-startup-hook))
 #+END_SRC

By default, this will show three lists, recent files and bookmarks and org-agenda items.
One more widget is implemented by Dashboard but it's made optional because of it's dependency on a third party application, which is
`projects` which shows you the list of known projectile projects.

** Emacs Daemon

In addition to the above, configure =initial-buffer-choice= to show
Dashboard in frames created with =emacsclient -c= as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq initial-buffer-choice (lambda () (get-buffer "*dashboard*")))
#+END_SRC

* Configuration

To update the banner or banner title

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
;; Set the title
(setq dashboard-banner-logo-title "Welcome to Emacs Dashboard")
;; Set the banner
(setq dashboard-startup-banner [VALUE])
;; Value can be
;; 'official which displays the official emacs logo
;; 'logo which displays an alternative emacs logo
;; 1, 2 or 3 which displays one of the text banners
;; "path/to/your/image.png which displays whatever image you would prefer
#+END_SRC

To customize which widgets are displayed, you can use the following snippet
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq dashboard-items '((recents  . 5)
                          (bookmarks . 5)
                          (projects . 5)
                          (agenda . 5)
                          (registers . 5)))
 #+END_SRC
This will add the recent files, bookmarks, projects, org-agenda and registers widgets to your dashboard each displaying 5 items.

To add your own custom widget is pretty easy, define your widget's callback function and add it to `dashboard-items` as such:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defun dashboard-insert-custom ()
  (insert "Custom text"))
(add-to-list 'dashboard-item-generators  '(custom . dashboard-insert-custom))
(add-to-list 'dashboard-items '(custom) t)
 #+END_SRC

** Org mode’s agenda

   To display today’s agenda items on the dashboard, add ~agenda~ to ~dashboard-items~:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(add-to-list 'dashboard-items '(agenda) t)
#+END_SRC

To show agenda for the upcoming seven days set the variable ~show-week-agenda-p~ to ~t~.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq show-week-agenda-p t)
#+END_SRC

Note that setting list-size for the agenda list is intentionally ignored; all agenda items for the current day will be displayed.

** Faces

It is possible to customize Dashboard's appearance using the following faces:

- ~dashboard-banner-logo-title-face~ ::
     Highlights the banner title.
- ~dashboard-heading-face~ ::
     Highlights widget headings.
- ~widget-button~ ::
     Highlights widget items.
